# UNet++: A Nested U-Net Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation
This is the implementation of Unet++ paper Using Keras. You can find the original paper at [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00889-5_1).

# U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation
To compare the performance and architecture, we also included U-Net code. You can find the original paper at [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)

## Prepare data and go to the root of data set folder
We used "Find the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discovery data set from 2018 Data Science Bowl [URL](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018). Download all data set and extract it. At the root of data set folder you can run python code or jupyter notebook.

### Execute the code with python
Execute
```
python3 unet.py
python3 unet++.py
```

### Execute the code with Jupyter notebook
